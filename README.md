Creative Portion:

We incorporated an importance value where you can insert and edit certain events by tagging them as important, which will then make them appear in red! You can also change them to be not important and they will no longer be red!

We also incorporated a list view where you can toggle a list view button to see all your events and their dates in a list! You can also collapse this list once you no longer want to view it!

we also incorporated a button where you can share an event to another user by inputting their username.

P.S. Ocassionally when deleting or updating events the calendar does not show correctly right after logging in. I've checked with multiple TAs and they said it's probably some sort of server lag and nobody knew how to fix it. So when deleting an event if it doesn't delete do it once more and it will delete it fromt he calendar.
